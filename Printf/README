# ft_printf

## About

**ft_printf** is a custom implementation of the `printf` function in C. This project aims to help understand how the standard `printf` function works by implementing a version of it from scratch. The project involves working with variable argument lists, type casting, and custom formatting.

---

## Features

The **ft_printf** function supports several format specifiers:

- **%s**: String
- **%d / %i**: Signed integers
- **%x / %X**: Unsigned hexadecimal integers
- **%c**: Character
- **%p**: Pointer address
- **%u**: Unsigned integers
- **%%**: Literal percent sign

Additional features such as width and precision formatting may also be supported depending on your implementation.

## Compiling ft_printf

### Steps to compile:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vinimoura99/42core.git
````

2. Navigate to the `ft_printf` directory:

   ```bash
   cd 42core/ft_printf
   ```

3. Run `make` to compile the library:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

   This will generate the `ft_printf.a` static library.

4. To clean up the compiled files:

   ```bash
   make clean
   ```

5. To remove all compiled objects and the `.a` file:

   ```bash
   make fclean
   ```

## Testing ft\_printf

To test your **ft\_printf** implementation, create a test program that calls `ft_printf` with various format specifiers and compare the output with the standard library `printf` to ensure correctness.

### Example usage:

1. Create a `main.c` file and include the necessary header:

   ```c
   #include "ft_printf.h"

   int main() {
       ft_printf("Hello, %s!\n", "World");
       ft_printf("Hexadecimal: %x\n", 255);
       ft_printf("Character: %c\n", 'A');
       return 0;
   }
   ```

2. Compile the program:

   ```bash
   gcc -o test_program main.c ft_printf.a
   ```

3. Run the test program:

   ```bash
   ./test_program
   ```
